            healthcare. Similar to the poverty levels, those state that have higher income averages will tend to have lower obesity and smoking percentages, while the lower income states will have higher obesity
            and smoking percentages. At the same time one will notice that income levels does not play a role on whether or not the percentage of citizens who lack healthcare will be high or low. Except for one outlier,
